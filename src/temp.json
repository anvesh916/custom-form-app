However, the professor states that it was actually a hunter and refutes the forementioned statement with three compelling reasons as descibed below.\n\nFirst, the reading states that the Robustus was small and only about a size of a cat. It was smaller than the two meter tall psittacosaur. Considering the huge difference in the size it would not hunted successfully. The professor oppose this claim by stating that the robustus could have hunted the baby pittacosaur rather than a fully grown one and it is feasible for the fully grown hunter which is almost two times larger than its prey to hunt.\n\nSecond, The reading states that the robustus cannot run faster than the psittacosaur due to the position of the legs. The legs of robustus were on the side making the animal difficult to run faster. The professor rejects this statement saying that there is another similar animal \"Tesmanian Devil\" which also has the similar structure of legs and this animal can run faster. So, if this animal can run faster then the robustus can also.\n\nThird, The reading posits that there were no evidence of teeth marks found on the bones found in the Robustus stomach and it could have just simply swallowed the unhatched eggs from the unguarded nest. The professor says that the robustus though have powerful jaws with which they hold their prey, they never used their back tooth to eat the animal.

Consider the modern school children who find their class projects and assignments using internet and submit them rather trying or solving with own ideas. They search their answers on the internet and directly use the solutions or the material presented online and just copy it.

Luckily he found one ready made project online to buy for a small amount of money. Now he got it delivered and submitted it as a project in his school. In this we can clearly see that the amount of needed to be performed by kid to learn new ideas is completely zero and the technology takesover the hard work.\n\nSocial networking has a great impact on the lives of the children. Networking with friends, teachers and relatives is good but with new generation technology in hands like mobile phone its very simpler to access.
